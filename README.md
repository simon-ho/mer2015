# Data files from "Simulating and detecting autocorrelation of molecular evolutionary rates among lineages"

Ho SYW, Duchene S, Duchene D (2015) Simulating and detecting autocorrelation of molecular evolutionary rates among lineages. Molecular Ecology Resources 15, 688–696.

Simulated data (10,000 nt alignments) in Nexus format. 

There are two folders: one contains the data sets simulated with a ‘high’ rate (5e-3 substitutions per site per time unit), and the other contains the data sets simulated with a ‘low’ rate (1e-3 substitutions per site per time unit). 

Within each of these two folders, the files are labelled according to the abbreviations used in Tables 1 and 2 of the paper:
sc = strict clock
acln = autocorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (with low L, medium M, or high H autocorrelation)
ucln = uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock (with low L or high H variation)
ucg = uncorrelated gamma relaxed clock (with low L or high H skew)

There are 10 replicate data sets for each setting.
